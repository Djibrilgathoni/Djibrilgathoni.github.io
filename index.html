      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in ethical hacking, digital forensics, and securing systems against modern threats. I explore systems not to break them—but to make them stronger. With hands-on practice from platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, I'm constantly learning and improving in real-world environments.</p>
