I'm a passionate cybersecurity student with a deep interest in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and digital defense. I thrive on uncovering vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them, and I'm committed to using my skills to strengthen the security posture of systems and networks.

Over time, I've gained hands-on experience through platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, where I've practiced real-world scenarios in threat detection, web application security, and privilege escalation. I’m continually learning about new attack vectors and defensive techniques to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.

Driven by curiosity, integrity, and a desire to protect, I aim to contribute to a safer internet—one secure system at a time.
